            <h1> Why is FGM performed?</h1>
            <p> Psychosexual reasons: FGM is carried out as a way to control women’s sexuality- it is thought to ensure virginity before marriage and fidelity afterward, and to increase male sexual pleasure. </p>
            <p>Sociological and cultural reasons: FGM is seen as part of a girl’s initiation into womanhood and as an intrinsic part of a community’s cultural heritage.</p>
            <p>Hygiene and aesthetic reasons: The external female genitalia are considered dirty and ugly and are removed, ostensibly to promote hygiene and aesthetic appeal.</p>
            <p> Religious reasons: Although FGM is not endorsed by either Islam or by Christianity, supposed religious doctrine is often used to justify the practice.</p>
            <p> Socio-economic factors: In many communities, FGM is a prerequisite for marriage. </p>

              <h1> What are the consequences for childbirth?</h1>
              <p style= "margin-bottom: 10%;"> A recent study found that those who had undergone FGM faced a significantly greater risk of requiring a Caesarean section, an episiotomy and an extended hospital stay, and also of suffering post-partum haemorrhage.</p>

                <h1> What are the different types of FGM?</h1>
                <p> Type I, also called clitoridectomy: <br> Partial or total removal of the clitoris and/or the prepuce.</p>
                <p> Type II, also called excision: <br> Partial or total removal of the clitoris and the labia minora, with or without excision of the labia majora. The amount of tissue that is removed varies widely from community to community.</p>
                <p> Type III, also called infibulation: <br> Narrowing of the vaginal orifice with a covering seal. The seal is formed by cutting and re-positioning the labia minora and/or the labia majora. This can take place with or without removal of the clitoris. </p>
                <p> Type IV: <br> All other harmful procedures to the female genitalia for non-medical purposes, for example: pricking, piercing, incising, scraping or cauterization. </p>

                <h1> Who performs FGM?</h1>
                <p> FGM is usually carried out by elderly people in the community (usually, but not exclusively, women) designated to perform this task or by traditional birth attendants. Among certain populations, FGM may be carried out by traditional health practitioners, (male) barbers, members of secret societies, herbalists or sometimes a female relative.</p>

                  <h1> How common is FGM? </h1>
                  <p> FGM is practised in at least 28 countries in Africa, as well as in parts of Asia,﻿ the Middle East and globally.</p>
                  <p> Prevalence rates vary significantly from country to country, ranging from nearly 98% in Somalia, 91% in Egypt and 94% in Sierra Leone, to less than 1% in Uganda. </p>

                    <h1> Is FGM practiced in the United States? </h1>
                    <p> in the U.S. Research conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that approximately 513,000 women and girls in the U.S. have either suffered the procedure or are at risk of FGM, a number that approximately doubled between 2000 and 2014.</p>

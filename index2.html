    <h1> What is FGM? </h1>
        <p> FGM refers to all procedures involving partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for cultural or other non-medical reasons. </p>
          </div>
          <div class= "AboutTextContainer">
            <h1> How is it performed? </h1>
                <p> FGM is carried out with special knives, scissors, scalpels, pieces of glass or razor blades. Anaesthetic and antiseptics are generally not used unless the procedure is carried out by medical practitioners. In communities where infibulations is practiced, girls' legs are often bound together to immobilize them for 10-14 days, allowing the formation of scar tissue. </p>

                  <div class= "AboutTextContainer">
                    <h1> How many women and girls are affected? </h1>
                        <p> An estimated 200 million girls and women alive today are believed to have been subjected to FGM; but rates of FGM are increasing, a reflection of global population growth.
                        If FGM practices continue at recent levels, 68 million girls will be cut between 2015 and 2030 in 25 countries where FGM is routinely practiced and more recent data are available.
                      In 2019, an estimated 4.1 million girls will be cut. This number of girls cut each year is projected to rise to 4.6 million girls in the year 2030.  </p>
